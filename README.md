UISplashScreen is a really simple, yet clean, way of providing a SplashScreen to your Java Application.

Since native implementation of Splash Screens come with no little shenanigans I came up with the necessity of creating a Splash Screen. This Splash Screen should be used to show the user a load progress screen while displaying a nice image such as Company logos or a presentation image.

That's what this Java class is designed for: A Swing frame combined with a little style and a really simple API for creating, updating and deleting it while we load resources and the libraries needed in the background.

This package contains the following items:

-doc: A little document showing how to use this class and the results it provides.
-src/main: A Main class which can be executed to show an example of the working class.
-src/resources: A folder containing a Creative-Commons image.
-src/splash: The SplashScreen class itself.
